# Build UI with Blok Design System

You are helping the user build UI components for a Sitecore Marketplace app using the Blok design system (Sitecore's shadcn-based component library).

## Key Principles

1. **Always use Blok components** — they match the Sitecore host UI and support light/dark themes automatically
2. **SDK data integration** — use loading states (Skeleton) and error states (Alert) when fetching SDK data
3. **Extension point awareness** — different extension types have different UI constraints (see below)
4. **Responsive** — components render inside iframes of varying sizes

## Installing Components

Blok components are installed via the shadcn CLI:

```bash
# Install the Blok theme (required first)
npx shadcn@latest add https://blok.sitecore.com/r/theme.json

# Install individual components
npx shadcn@latest add https://blok.sitecore.com/r/<component-name>.json
```

See [blok-components.md](references/blok-components.md) for the full component catalog with install commands.

## UI Patterns by Extension Type

### Compact Field (custom-field)
- Very limited space (~300px wide, variable height)
- Use: Input, Select, Badge, small inline components
- Avoid: Tables, large layouts, modals

### Dashboard Widget
- Medium space (~400x300px default, resizable)
- Use: Cards, Charts, Stats, compact Tables
- Good for: Summary data, quick actions

### Pages Context Panel
- Side panel (~350px wide, full height)
- Use: Vertical layouts, Lists, Accordion, Tabs
- Good for: Contextual info about current page, actions

### Fullscreen
- Full viewport within the Sitecore shell
- Use: Any components, complex layouts, Tables, Forms
- Good for: Full CRUD interfaces, dashboards, settings

### Standalone
- Independent page, not in Sitecore shell
- Use: Any components, full creative freedom
- Good for: Public-facing pages, OAuth callbacks

## SDK Data Integration Pattern

```tsx
"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useMarketplaceClient, useAppContext } from "@/components/providers/marketplace";
import { Skeleton } from "@/components/ui/skeleton";
import { Alert, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";

export function MyComponent() {
  const { client } = useMarketplaceClient();
  const appContext = useAppContext();
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const loading = !appContext;

  if (loading) return <Skeleton className="h-32 w-full" />;
  if (error) return <Alert variant="destructive"><AlertDescription>{error}</AlertDescription></Alert>;

  return <div>{/* Render data */}</div>;
}
```
